# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21 Challenge

Hello! 

For this challenge, the data was preprocessed and the model was compiled, trained and evaluated in the file titled AlphabetSoupCharity using Google Colab. The corresponding AlphabetSoupCharity.h5 file goes along with it. 

My model optimization attempts may be found in the AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization folder. I made three different attempts each with their own Google Colab and h5 files. 

Lastly, my write up is entitled DeepLearningReport. 

Thanks!
